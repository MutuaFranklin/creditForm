## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Requirements
1. The form must contain an intro window, at least four steps and a summary.
2. Only one question must be visible at one time.
3. Every question is mandatory, no skipping!
4. You should be able to come back to the previous step.
5. At least one question should depend on the answer to a previous question.
6. Some kind of error messages should be shown.
7. The summary should contain the answers to all questions (don‘t need to save
data anywhere).
8. The design must be responsive – it will be tested on a mobile device (iPhone5) and a desktop browser (FullHD screen).
9. The end result should be put in any public repository of your choice (GitHub, BitBucket,
GitLab, etc.).
10. The form should work when accessing index.html through a browser.
11. If you use some kind of build tools, write a README file how to launch the
form.
12. It would be great if this piece of software will contain unit tests.
